My name is Priyanshu Sharma. I'm a software engineer and an AI Engineer. I'm originally from Chandigarh, Punjab, but I moved to Mumbai to have great exposure & best working experience.
Besides AI and programming, I love exploring India—its places, cultures, and food. I also tutor, enjoy cooking, and pursue spiritual growth.

I am Priyanshu Sharma, a Software Developer and AI Engineer with 2+ years of professional experience, currently based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. I specialize in Agentic AI systems, automation, and full-stack application development, with a strong focus on building production-ready, reliable AI solutions that solve real business problems.

I have strong hands-on expertise in Python and JavaScript, and I actively work across the full stack using frameworks and tools such as FastAPI, Django, Flask, REST APIs, Streamlit, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I am comfortable designing backend architectures, building APIs, integrating AI services, and delivering complete end-to-end solutions.

My core strength lies in AI and Generative AI engineering. I have hands-on experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, OCR, multi-agent systems, and computer vision-based workflows. I have worked extensively with LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI APIs, Gemini, LLaVA, GPT-4V, Hugging Face, Ollama, Groq AI, Nvidia models, and Vision LLMs, and I enjoy building context-aware, agentic AI systems rather than hard-coded logic.

Currently, I am working as an AI Engineer at Capgemini, where I have contributed to several high-impact enterprise projects. I worked on an AI-powered access management platform for an Automotive Customer (North America), which reduced manual validation time by 40% and improved analytics response time by 30%, significantly enhancing security workflows.

For a Life Sciences Customer (Europe), I delivered an agentic framework for BI applications, developing intelligent AI-agents for advanced data extraction and automation, enabling self-service analytics and user guidance for complex business ecosystems.

I have also led and contributed to Capgemini's internal AI initiatives, including VisionCopilot—a screen-aware agentic AI assistant that analyzes live screen context using computer vision and LLMs to detect user tasks and deliver proactive suggestions. This solution automated routine workflows, reduced manual effort by 35%, and improved productivity for 150+ users across business units.

In addition, I designed and implemented an Automated Legal Document Review Agent, leveraging OCR, NLP, RAG, and LLMs to automate contract analysis and compliance checks. This system processes 4000+ documents per month with around 90% accuracy, reducing review time by 2 hours per case and significantly improving regulatory adherence.

Before Capgemini, I worked as an Associate Engineer at Teqmavens Pvt Ltd, where I contributed to CRM-based client projects, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and consistently delivered tasks ahead of schedule.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Chitkara University, with a CGPA of 9.66, which reflects my strong fundamentals in computer science, problem-solving, and software engineering.

I have solid experience working with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL, as well as vector databases like ChromaDB. I am comfortable designing secure APIs, JWT-based authentication, scalable backend systems, and cloud-based AI integrations.

I am known for thinking system-first, focusing on clean architecture, reliability, and real-world impact. I enjoy experimenting with new AI tools, building intelligent agents, and turning complex requirements into practical, working solutions.

Alongside technical skills, I bring strong soft skills, including leadership, teamwork, time management, planning, and public speaking. I have experience leading teams, mentoring peers, and explaining complex technical concepts in a simple and practical manner.

I have been recognized with the “Shining Star” award at Capgemini and have completed certifications in Agentic AI Engineering, Python, and Generative AI.

Outside of work, I am interested in programming, teaching and tutoring, spiritual growth, fitness, traveling, and creating content. I communicate fluently in Hindi and have intermediate working proficiency in English.

Overall, I see myself as a builder and problem-solver, deeply passionate about AI-driven automation, intelligent systems, and creating tools that meaningfully improve productivity and workflows.
